I freeze time; I photograph. I have 50++ years of computer programming and software development.
Computer software engineer (C#, .Net), retired but active for personal projects. I have witnessed two final space flights: the US half of the Apollo/Soyuz Test Project, and Space Shuttle STS-135 Atlantis with the Final Four [CDR Chris Ferguson, PLT Doug Hurley, MS1 Sandra Magnus,  MS2 Rex Walheim]<br><br>
Now that I am retired, I am getting into the Arduino ecosystem.

# Damn Near Death 
April 2021 began my continual year of hell. Time in the hospital :hospital:, life altering surgery. I confessed to my wife :red_haired_woman: at the end of May that "Life wasn't worth living." I self diagnosed myself with "situational depression". Discharged to a physical rehab facility (place was a hell hole). Insurance kicked me home üè°. During a telemedicne call with my primary care doctor :man_health_worker:. I mentioned the same thing. He said "Think of what you're going through as climbing up a mountain ‚õ∞Ô∏è. It's tough going uphill, but when you reach the top, it's all downhill." I said "At least you didn't use the train :train: metaphor." He replied "The light at the end of the tunnel is another train :train2:?"

September 30<sup>th</sup>, 2021, I made a trip to the ER :hospital: after recreating a scene from The Exorcist: projectile vomiting. They got me settled and sent me home. That night, I wasn't in pain, I just felt "unusual". Another call to 911. ER arrived and my BP was 80 over 50. I lost an organ in emergency surgery. That afternoon in recovery, my wife asked the surgeon :man_health_worker: to change my status to DNR. He thought that was the appropriate decision. My depression worsens to severe. After discharge, back at a physical therapy rehab facility, learning to walk again. Left hip replacement in July 2022. I learned about creating instructions to be left behind from Chrissy LeMaire's presentation during a Women In Technology webinar during Mental Health Day. I have a "Far Side" sense of humor, so I termed her GitHub repository of instructions for her spouse left behind, an EOL, a Microsoft term for End Of Life.<br>

# Interests 
As an INTP on the Myers-Briggs Personality Assessment, my career in software development was a natural match; I have enjoyed computer programming and software development since my introduction to computer programming in my first engineering class at the University of South Carolina College of Engineering. Our class chose to use the department's Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-8 minicomputer programming in FOCAL (similar to Dartmouth BASIC). In the next class, we learned to program using the PDP-8 assembly language; which provided the basis for learning other computers instruction sets: Intel 8080/8085, DEC PDP-8 and PDP-11, Motorola 68000, and IBM 360/370. Computer high-level languages: C, C++, C# & .Net, Fortran IV, Java, PL/1, SNOBOL, Algol, Pascal, Visual Basic, Dartmouth BASIC, APL, and Delphi. Operating Systems: Windows, Unix, and Linux. Web markup languages: HTML, JavaScript, and XML.
## Software Development
In between my employment at NCR E&M-Columbia and SC DHEC, I had a brief tour of duty at Policy Management System (Stock Symbol: PMS). This was during the time when they were fined by the Securities and Exchange Commission because its executive and senior executives booked revenue on December 32<sup>nd</sup>. I have also worked for a few DOT-COM'S :fireworks: that became DOT-BOMB'S :bomb: <br>
- Affinity Technology Group (Stock Symbol: AFFI)
- HealthMagic
- Global Health Technology (bought by CBSI aka Covansys)<br>

As a Software Developer at the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control, I developed web applications using C# and .Net using Microsoft Visual Studio and Microsoft SQL Server and IBM DB/2 databases. I have also written Windows services to monitor the health of web applications, their associated databases, SSL certificate expiration and network connectivity to alert the appropriate teams.
Besides developing Windows services to monitor web applications and their associated databases, I have developed services to extract data for SFTP file exports on a monthly basis, update SCSERV hospitals and clinics in Microsoft SQL Server with reference data from the EFIS Oracle database.
<br><br>
One large scale Windows application that I developed using C# and .Net for my personal use read the NASA mission schedules for the Space Shuttle missions that they published as Excel spreadsheets and created events in the calendar of Microsoft Outlook using Microsoft Visual Studio Tools for Office. I thought that others would be interested in using the application also, so I published the installation executable with the source code on  Microsoft‚Äôs now decommissioned source code publishing site, Codeplex; I migrated it over to GitHub although support of the application officially ended with wheelstop of Atlantis on mission STS-135 with the Final Four, CDR Chris Ferguson, PLT Doug Hurley, MS1 Sandy Magnus, and MS2 Rex Walheim. 
## NASA Spaceflight 
On July 8, 2011, I was able to check off a 30 year old bucket list item: witness a Space Shuttle launch in person. I also had the opportunity that few people have seen; I, as well as forty-nine other people by the Shuttle Landing Facility Control Tower, got to see Atlantis land for the final time on July 21, 2013. I have witnessed two final manned spaceflights in person, Atlantis and the US half of Apollo/Soyuz Test Project on July 15, 1975. Atlantis was the second final manned spaceflight that I witnessed in person.
## Photography 
Photography is another creative endeavor that I have enjoyed almost as long as I've used computers. My first 35mm SLR was and still own and use is the Canon A-1, an innovative camera in 1980 with its shutter priority, aperture priority, program, stoped-down metering, and manual control; I added a few accessories, and a few lenses. July 2013, I added one of my ‚Äúbucket list‚Äù cameras, a Canon F-1N with the AE Finder FN, AE Motor Drive FN. I added digital to the mix with the Canon 5D Mark III and the Canon EF 24-105mm f4L.

| Bucket List Cameras | Status |

| Canon F-1N, Canon FN Motor Drive FN, Canon AE Finder FN | July  2013 |

| Mamiya RB67 or RZ67||

## Beagles 
Paula and I have had and raised Beagles since 1979 when someone dropped a Beagle off in our
neighborhood, who we named Sport. We have put the obedience title, Companion Dog (CD) on Ranger and 
Runner. We got Writer and Rebecca from conformation breeder and they have earned Championships along
with the CD obedience titles.


We have bred and raised a few litters. 
## Hobbies
I enjoy water-skiing. I learned on Lake Greenwood, South Carolina. I consider Lake Murray, 
South Carolina to be my "home lake" since I live nearby. My wife, Paula, and I would camp
at Hamilton Branch State Park on Clark Hill Lake, South Carolina and Georgia.

Bodies of Water That I Have Skiied:
- South Carolina Lakes 
   - Lake Greenwood
   - Lake Murray
   - Clark Hill Lake
- Midwestern Rivers
   - Cedar River (Cedar Rapids, Iowa)
   - Mississippi River (between the Quad Cities of Davenport and Bettendorf, Iowa, and Rock Island and Moline, Illinois)<br>
